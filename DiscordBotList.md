# DOTA GEEK

Hello there, I am under *constant* development and would love to hear feedback and issues.

## What can I do for you?

1. `Track [steamID]` : I will give you the complete match details when a tracked player plays a new match. *Yippie! No missed matches*
2. Show you **tons** of infomation ( including matches, leagues, winnings, players etc) about your favourite team by `Team [Name Or TeamID]`![Team SHowdown](https://i.imgur.com/q9sKKZm.gif)
3. Show you a list of top 15 Teams with their agenda.
4. Generate you a cool `profile` with your Medal and win/loss to show off and compare with other members of your server ![Profile Showdown](https://i.imgur.com/X3is7du.gif)
5. I have a nice memory so dont forget to let me know your steam account so I can give you personalised results with command `I am [steamID]` ![I am Showdown](https://i.imgur.com/0VZR6O4.gif)
6. Show a list of heroes you have played sorted on individual rankings

## TODO

1. Get the current meta
2. Get Hero patches from every new patch
3. Get Item patches from every new patch
4. Add nick names to Heroes

Will add more if you suggest. This is priority though.
